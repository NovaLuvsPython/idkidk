How does it work?

It uses a lot of proxies to check to check random generated codes,
if its Invalid it skips and if its a Valid one it saves the code in Valid.txt

Important: turn off any secuity if you have them activated because it can stop the generating,
procces and skip Valid nitro codes.

-- Extra --
Rate: 100 scans per sec
Valid Chance: 1 valid per 1 hr(s)

Codes can be random like from 400 rbx to 13k.
